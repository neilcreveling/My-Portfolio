# My-Portfolio
Neil Creveling's professional portfolio web page.

A web developer's portfolio acts as an employer's first look at who you are as a professional. This page should display a designer's strongest work, provide essentials such as contact information, and reflect one's personality and general approach to web design. It is crucial for all web developers, on the job hunt or otherwise, to have a professional portfolio webpage containing multiple deployed projects readily available at all times.

##Basic Functionality
Starting off, I made sure to include a clear heading with my name navigation bar at the top of my page. When one clicks on each of the options on the bar, the page scrolls down to the appropriate sections of the body of the web page. This allows for simple and quick access to each of the different parts contained within the webpage, rather than having to clumsily scroll through a disorganized page.

##About Me
The about me section provides a concise description of who I am, both as a developer and an individual. I made sure to provide what my skills are as a designer, my educational background, and a few personal facts to provide the viewer with a rounded vision of who I am.

##Work
In the work section, I provided images of my projects that link to the deployed page so that visitors can get a taste of what the project appears before accessing the actual page. I made sure to make my most recent project larger than the others to give it dominance and attract viewers, especially possible employers, to it.

##Contact Me
At the bottom of the page I provide a simple list of contact information with accompanying links so visitors can easily contact me via a variety of media.

##Style
I added some stylish flair to the web page to grab the viewers attention and show off my own personality. I added a subtitle section in between the header and the body which can be customized to any eye-catching or thought provoking message. I styled the box around the subtitle and my name to add a personal touch and bring some attractive design continuity in the header, a place that all visitors will see first.

##Dynamism
With the use of media queries, I made sure that my web page would be functional, neat, and attractive regardless of the visitor's screen size.
